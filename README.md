# Hangman--Python-Project by Badrinath

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. You will be prompted with underscores representing the letters of a randomly chosen word.
3. Enter a single letter to guess. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you lose an attempt.
5. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
